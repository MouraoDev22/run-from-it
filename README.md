# 🎈 Run From IT

An endless runner inspired by the classic Dino Run formula.
You play as Pennywise sprinting through the frozen streets of Derry during a winter night, endlessly chasing a child who refuses to slow down.

The goal is simple. Survive as long as possible. Jump over obstacles. Keep the chase alive.

## 🕹 Gameplay

This is a fast, minimal endless runner focused on timing and reflex.

You run automatically.
Your only job is to jump and avoid obstacles.

The longer you survive, the faster the game becomes.

## 🎮 Controls

Super complicated control scheme incoming:

| Action | Key               |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| Jump   | Space             |
| Jump   | Left Mouse Button |

Yes, that is it.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

Built with speed and simplicity in mind.

* JavaScript
* Kaplay game library

This project was made to focus on gameplay and product delivery rather than spending months learning art pipelines.

## 🎨 Asset Credits

To accelerate production and compensate for limited design experience, the visual pipeline used AI tools:

* Base and static sprites generated with the latest ChatGPT model
* Background generated with the latest Gemini Pro model
* Animations generated with Ludo.ai

All assets were curated and integrated manually into the game.
